  
What is it?

A full stack standings/statistics website I created for my Monday night pickup
hockey skates.

How does it work?

Keeps track of team standings and player stats. I perfrom updates on the stats  adn standings every week
after the skate has finished.

What did I learn?

I learned how to create a backend server using Node.js and Express 
I learned how to upload data to a database and use it in the website
I leanred about the different requests that the client can make to the server and the 
response options from the server to the client.
