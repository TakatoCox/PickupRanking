What is it?

A fullstack stadnings/stats website for my monday night pickup hockey league.

How does it work?

Keeps tracks of team and player stats and store them in MongoDB database. 
Serves files using NodeJS backend code and diplays the data onto the front end for the client.

What did I learn?

I learned how to make a full stack application from the front end to the backend. 
I learned how to store data onto a database and access the data from the backend.
I learned how to serve file with NodeJS to the client/front End.
